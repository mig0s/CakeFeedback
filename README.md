# CakeShop Feedback System

The system was developed as an assignment for Web Programming module of my Higher Diploma. MySQL was used as a database for this project. The information below is courtesy of TMC Academy, Singapore, and it is a detailed description of the system and functions implemented.

### Background

> The owner of “The Cake Shop” has asked you
> to modify the on-line enquiry form for customers. The data from the form should be captured
> and stored in the MySQL database.
> You are also asked to create an administration page for the administrator to login. This page
> should be link to the main web page.
> An Administrator account and function must also be created to allow for viewing, editing and
> deleting of the user information. Your administration page should retain the same look and feel
> as your website and should be designed using PHP and MYSQL as the main
> language and database.

### Key Features
- All data keyed in by the users need to be validated before being processed by the server.
- Administrators need to be able to login.
- There should be a logout function for administrators.
- Administrators can View / Delete / Edit all entries of the users who have made enquiries.
- All coding should be appropriately commented, highlighting key features and variables.
